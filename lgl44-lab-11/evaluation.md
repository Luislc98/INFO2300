# Cognitive Walkthrough Evaluation

## Personas

1. Briefly describe **Abby**'s motivations, attitudes, how she works with technology and learns.
    Abby is willing to learn new technology in order to be more effective at completing her tasks, but strongly prefers to use technolgy
    she is already familiar with instead of learning new technology. She tends to want to learn through instructions such as tutorials and prefers to gather as much information as possible prior to attempting to solve a problem. She is wary of learning new tech and often blames herself when she can't use it effectively.

    [1-2 sentences]

2. How does **Tim**'s motivations, attitudes, how he works with technology and learns _differ_ from Abby's.
    Tim is very comfortable trying out new technology and often goes out of his way to do so, sometimes making his work harder than it is supposed to be. When attempting to learn new technology and failing to do so, Tim often beleives that it is the software's vendor fault that the design is faulty. In problem solving, Tim tends to adopt an incremental approach to problem solving, he uses a select amount information to explore a possible solution and if that doesnt work he tries another one.
    [2-3 sentences]

3. How does **Pat**'s (Patricia or Patrick) motivations, attitudes, how she works with technology and learns _compare_ to Abby's and Tim's.
    Pat's attitudes to technology are sort of an intermediary between Tim and Abby. He is not as insecure about his technology skills as Abby and doesn't get discouraged as quickly when hes struggling to use new technology, but he is not as confident as Tim to blame the software vendor isntead of himself. He does have the same comprehemsive problem solving style as Abby.
    [2-3 sentences]

4. Which persona feels the most like the _opposite_ of your own technological problem solving styles?
    Abby. I persoanlly learn more when trying out new software by fiddling with all the new features and learning from the results. In contrast, Abby prefers to look up tutorials and handbooks to learn prior to playing around with the new software. I am also fearly confident of my ability to adapt new technolgy and wouldnt immediately get discouraged and blame myself like Abby does.

## Scenario

[Identify the subgoals and actions for this scenario.]

Hortense, an entomologist, is a volunteer for the 2300 Zoo. Many of the creatures on the website are missing labels. Hortense was asked by the general manager to update the labels for all insects.

- Subgoal 1: [TODO]
  - Action 1A: [TODO]
  - Action 1B: [TODO]
  - ...
- Subgoal 2: [TODO]
  - Action 2A: [TODO]
  - ...
- ...

[Add as many subgoals as you needs]
**Subgoal # 1 : select the insects that need to be labeled**
	(e.g., "# 1 : Select the section of the document you want to print")

  - Will [persona name] have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Motivations/Strategies.)
        Because Abby is a comprehensive problem solver, she will try looking at the entire website first, so she will be able to find where
        to select the animals
        [Tell us why..]

[Add as many actions as you need...]
**Action # 1[action number] : select animal to add label to**
	(e.g., "# 1 : Put the mouse at the beginning of the section you want to print")

  - Will [persona name] know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] Yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
        There is a checkbox next to each animal, and I think it is a common enough design/idea that Abby will know to select it
        despite her being insecure about new technology
        [Tell us why...]

  - If [persona name] does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] Yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
        I think that this design is common enough that it may have been in software Abby is familiar with and therefore she would know she was
        making progress
        [Tell us why...]


**Subgoal # 2 : add the correct lablel to each insect**


  - Will [persona name] have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Motivations/Strategies.)
        Because Abby is a comprehensive problem solver, she will try looking at the entire website first, so she will be able to find the add label  button and deduce that that is what she will need to update the labels
        [Tell us why..]

    **Action # 1[action number] : select label to give to animal**


  - Will [persona name] know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
        I think that Abby might get confused and think that one is supposed to type in the label. This is due to her being not confident when
        facing new technology
        [Tell us why...]

  - If [persona name] does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] Maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
        Abby is averse to risk and her skill with technology so she might be unsure about if what she is doing is correct.
        [Tell us why...]


    **Action # 2[action number] : click the add ot delete button to update label of animal**


  - Will [persona name] know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
        I think that Abby might get confused and think that one is supposed to type in the label. This is due to her being not confident when
        facing new technology
        [Tell us why...]

  - If [persona name] does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes/maybe/no] Maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
        Abby is averse to risk and her skill with technology so she might be unsure about if what she is doing is correct.

## Analysis

1. What usability issues did you discover?
    There is no confirmation of the fact that an animal is selected so the user could potentially be unsure on how to select.

2. What inclusiveness bugs did you discover?
    Woman tend to use comprehensive problem solving, and the design make it hard for people to realize if what they're doing is wrong without first experiemnting.

3. Propose a few ideas how to address these issues.

    Adding instructions on how to select and add stuff would help people know what they're doing. this would solve the usability issue. Adding
    markers that indicate a person's progress would solve the inclusiveness bug.
